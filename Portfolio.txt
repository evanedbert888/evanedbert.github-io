<h2> Skills </h2>
<h3> Writing </h3>
<p> I am still a beginner yet quite confident in my writing. Guide me and I will show what I can do. The funny thing is that my writing is quite a haywire in several occasions. </p>
<p> Whether the maximum is more than 5 pages or 1000 words, I can make it longer if it is possible and vice-versa. Therefore, it is one of my skills. </p>
<p> This is a digital certificate I got for participating in a short story competition. </p>

<h3> PHP Web Programming </h3>
<p> During my fifth semester, I became quite interested in web programming after my midtest project to make a web using PHP. </p>
<p> I was thinking that it can help my UI/UX perspective. I am still a beginner but I want to learn more about it & I hope someone could guide me though. </p>
